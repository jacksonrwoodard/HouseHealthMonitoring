# Mold Module Signoff

## Subsystem Function
The function of the mold module subsystem is to detect if mold is likely to grow within the surrounding environment of the sensor. The SHT30 Temperature and Humidity Sensor will gather temperature and humdity levels and send its respective data to an ESP8266 micro-controller. The mold module will send data to the ESP8266 every hour to allow for computations of the average values.
