# Head Unit Signoff

## Subsystem Function
The function of the head unit is to display active and historical data about each sensor that is used in the entire system. The head unit will be able to determine the differences between each sensor and catergorize the sensors together based on what room they are placed in. It will also be able to detect if the data from the sensor has reached the specified limit for each sensor and display a warning and start a timer if necessary. 

## Subsystem Constraints
| No. | Constraints | Origin |
| --- | ----------- | ------ |
|  1  | The head unit shall know what sensor is sending data to it, the sensors location, and be able to differentiate from other sensors. | Team Supervisor & Project Team |
|  2  | The head unit shall be able to display and log active and historical data from sensors. | Project Team & Team Supervisor |
|  3  | The head unit shall be able to detect if the fire module temperature is at 176&#176; Fahrenheit or higher and display a warning. | Project Team |
|  4  | The head unit shall be able to receive data from the water module to display a warning if water is present and the total water depth. | Project Team |
|  5  | The head unit shall be able to receive data and follow OSHA standards for ammonia, propane, and carbon oxides (50 ppm, 1000 ppm, and 50 ppm respectively over an eight hour window). | Standards & Project Team |
|  6  | The head unit shall be able to intrepret, from the recieved data, that mold could form if the humidity levels exceed 50% and temperatures range between 55&176; and 85&176; Fahrenheit for a minimum of two days. | Project Team |

<sup>1</sup> The head unit needs to know what sensor is sending data to it, the sensors location, and be able to differentiate from other sensors. This allows us to identify which sensor is detecting an issue to let the home owner know where an issue has occured and what type of issue has occured. 

<sup>2</sup> The head unit is responsible for displaying all logged data from the sensor modules. The historical data is important for showing that the house has not had any issues like mold buildup, fire, water buildup, or gas leaks. If an issue has occured then the system should be able to show how long there is a type of issue. This information is can be used to prove the value of a house.

<sup>3</sup> The head unit checks if temperatures have been at 176&176; Fahrenheit or higher, since 176&176; Farhenheit is the ignition temperature of drywall. 

<sup>4</sup> The head unit needs to receieve if water has
