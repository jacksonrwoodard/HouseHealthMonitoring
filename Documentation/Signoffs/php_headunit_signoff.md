# Head Unit Signoff

## Subsystem Function
The function of the head unit is to display active and historical data about each sensor that is used in the entire system. The head unit will be able to determine the differences between each sensor and catergorize the sensors together based on what room they are placed in. It will also be able to detect if the data from the sensor has reached the specified limit for each sensor and display a warning and start a timer if necessary. 

## Subsystem Constraints
  * The head unit shall know what sensor is sending data to it, the sensors location, and be able to differentiate from other sensors.
  * The head unit shall be able to display and log active and historical data from sensors.
  * The head unit shall be able to detect if the fire module temperature is at 176&#176; Fahrenheit or higher and display a warning.
  * The head unit shall be able to receive data from the water module to display a warning if water is present and the total water depth.
  * The head unit shall be able to receive data and follow OSHA standards for ammonia, propane, and carbon oxides (50 ppm, 1000 ppm, and 50 ppm respectively over an eight hour window).
  * The head unit shall be able to intrepret, from the recieved data, that mold could form if the humidity levels exceed 50% and temperatures range between 55&176; and 85&176; Fahrenheit for a minimum of two days.
