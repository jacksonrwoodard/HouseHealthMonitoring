# Communication Module Signoff

## Subsytem Function
The function of the communcation subsystem is to act as a transmitter for each of the sensor modules and a reciever for the headunit. The function of the transmitter is to send the sensor name, data type, sensor number, and sensor data. The function of the reciever is to recieve all of the data from the sensor modules and make the recieved information avaliable for the processor.

|  1  | Sensors shall not be placed in a way where they cannot wirelessly communicate with the system. | Project Team & Broader Implications |
|  2  | System shall not require an internet connection to work and communicaton with the head unit and sensors | Home Owners, Insurance Agencies, & Team Supervisor |
|  3  | Sensor communication shall send the sensor name, number, data type, and raw data to the head unit. | Project Team |
|  4  | System shall be powered by standard 120 V, 60 Hz wall power | Standards |

<sup>1</sup> In order for the system to work properly all of the sensors have to be able to communicate with the head unit.
