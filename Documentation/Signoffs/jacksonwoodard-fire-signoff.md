# Fire Module Signoff

## Subsystem Function
The function of the fire module subsystem is to detect if a fire has ever occured in a specific room in a house. The system will work by using a IR Temperature Sensor that is installed on the ceiling of a room with a piece of copper that will be the source for the temperature sensor to aim at to recieve the temperature.
