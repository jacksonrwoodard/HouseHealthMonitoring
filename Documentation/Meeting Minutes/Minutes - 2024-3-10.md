Additions to the Agenda
Cole has ordered a new USB antenna for use as a receiver from the modules. The XBee s2c was not communicating with the head unit resulting in a new device needed.

Jackson, Dylan, Nate, and Luke are continuing the conversion of code from Arduino’s ESP IDE to Espressif’s ESP IDE. Espressif is the manufacturer of the ESP devices and we have found that wireless communication works better using the Espressif IDE.
