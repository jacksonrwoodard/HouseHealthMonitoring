Additions to the Agenda
Luke was able to add the schematic updates to the gas module in order to get it signed off.

Cole got feedback from Dr. Bhattacharya about what battery type and charging circuit would be best fit for the project. The battery type mentioned is a Lithium Iron Phosphate battery, while the recommended charging circuit is a voltage divider trickle charger. This type of battery will allow for 10 years of use with instant power swap over for continual usage of our sensor modules. 

Agenda for Next Meeting
Start team discussion of minimal functionality of this project.
