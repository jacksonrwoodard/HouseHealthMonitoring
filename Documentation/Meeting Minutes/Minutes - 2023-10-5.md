Additions to the Agenda
A decent amount of discussion around making sure the project proposal follows the
supplied rubric was done. We ended up dividing the workload between each member in
order to speed up the editing process. After each individual section was completed, the
team went through and reviewed the edited information to ensure the goals of the rubric
were properly met this time around. This process was then repeated for the conceptual
design and the conceptual design block diagram.
Agenda for Next Meeting
Final edits for the conceptual design and block diagram will be covered next meeting.
