Additions to the Agenda
The team is thinking about submitting the head unitâ€™s design first. Questions of what data and how much will be sent and stored. We also need to know how often the data will be stored by the head unit. We will need to know specifics like how the power input can handle ripple voltage and current. The team has also recognized that there might be certain points where we have multiple good options to do the same job, leaving a more or less arbitrary decision. 

Agenda for Next Meeting
The completion of our first design submission.
