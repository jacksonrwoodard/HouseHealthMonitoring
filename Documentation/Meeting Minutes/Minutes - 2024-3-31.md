Approval of Agenda
This meeting was approved by Jackson Woodard.

Business From Previous Meeting
Finish any additional sections of additional functionality needed.

New Business 
No new business this week.

Additions to the Agenda
Cole, Dylan, and Luke were able to successfully set the headunit to be able to receive and display the information generated by the sensor modules.

Jackson and Nate are fine tuning a new code to allow for more sensor-modules to head-unit communication. This step has been extremely time intensive due to a lack of example ESP32 H2 example codes. This lack of example codes is most likely due to the ESP32 H2 being so new to the market. 

Agenda for Next Meeting
The first order of business is the continuation of work on additional module communication with the head-unit.

The next order of business is comparing the existing function of the overall system with the determined success and constraint metrics.

Adjournment 
Meeting was adjourned at 3:00 PM by Jackson Woodard. With planning of meeting again on April 8, 2024 at 1:00 PM.
