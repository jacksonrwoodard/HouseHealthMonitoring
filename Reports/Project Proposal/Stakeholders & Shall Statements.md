## Shall Statements

  - We shall create a system that monitors your house using sensors that will be connected to a head unit that displays all data related to the sensors. The system will be easy to use so that any home owner would not sturggle
to maintain their house. The sensors are going to be wireless and powered by battries. The house history data will be easily accessable through the head unit.  We are going to create a system that is cost efficient to most home owners, home inspection companies, and insurance companies.

  - We shall not create a system that is too complicatied for the average person to use. We shall not violate any building codes or standards. The system will not be a distraction, it will be simple looking cases that hold the sensors to look aesthetically pleasing and some of the sensors will not even be visable.
