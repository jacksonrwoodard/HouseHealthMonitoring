## Shall Statements

  - We shall create a system that monitors your house using sensors that will be connected to a head unit that displays all active data related to the sensors. The system will be easy to use so that any home owner would not sturggle to maintain their house. The sensors are going to be hard wired to the house and have a built-in battery backup system. The house history data will be easily accessible through the head unit.  We are going to create a system that is cost efficient to most home owners, landlords, and insurance companies.

  - We shall not create a system that is too complicatied for the average person to use. We shall not violate any building codes or standards. To not be a distraction, the sensors will be housed in cases to look aesthetically pleasing and some of the sensors will not even be visible.
