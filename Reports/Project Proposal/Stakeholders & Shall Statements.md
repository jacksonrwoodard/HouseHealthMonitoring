## Shall Statements

1) The Head unit shall know what sensor is sending data to
it, the sensor’s location, and be able to differentiate from
other sensors. This originated from the team supervisor.
2) The Head unit shall be able to display and log active
and historical data from sensors. This originated from
the project team and team supervisor.
3) Head unit shall be able to detect if the fire module
temperature is at 176 degrees Fahrenheit or higher and
display a warning [4]. This originated from the project
team based on the ignition temperature of drywall.
4) The Head unit shall be able to receive data from the
water module to display a warning if water is present and
the total water depth. This originated from the project
team.
5) Head unit shall receive data from the gas module and
follow OSHA standards for ammonia, propane, and carbon oxides (50 ppm, 1000 ppm, and 50 ppm respectively
over an eight-hour window) [5]. This originated from the
OSHA standards for the project.
6) Head unit shall be able to interpret, from the received
data, that mold could form if the humidity levels exceed
50% and temperatures range between 55 degrees and 85
degrees Fahrenheit for a minimum of two days [6]. This
originated from the project team based on the conditions
in which mold can grow.
7) Head unit shall be able to receive the sensor name,
number, data type, and raw data. This originated from
the team supervisor.
8) System shall be primarily powered from the house’s 120
V power supply. This originated from the project team.
9) Shall be a semi-permanent system that will last for up to
thirty years. This originated from the team supervisor.
10) Shall have a backup power system that will allow the
system to function in case of a primary power outage
for up to two continuous weeks. This originated from
both a standard and the team supervisor.
11) Shall fully function without regularly changing sensors
or head unit batteries. This originated from all external
stakeholders and the team supervisor.
12) Sensor modules shall not be placed in a way where they
cannot wirelessly communicate with the system. This
originated from the project team and broader implications.
13) Modules shall not be a distraction for a homeowner, and
not be directly visible. This originated from all external
stakeholders and the team supervisor.
14) The Water module shall be able to detect multiple water
levels and determine if water is present. This originated
from the project team.
15) The Mold module shall be able to detect the current
temperatures and humidity levels in an area and send it
to the head unit. This originated from the project team.
16) The Gas module shall be able to detect ammonia,
propane, and carbon oxide. This originated from the
project team and the insurance companies.
17) The Fire module shall be able to detect the temperature
of the sensor and send the data to the head unit. This
originated from the project team.
18) System shall not require an internet connection to work
and communicate with the head unit and sensors. This
originated from homeowners, insurance agencies, and
the team supervisor.
19) Sensor communication shall send the sensor name, number, data type, and raw data to the head unit. This
originated from the project team.
20) System shall not collect additional data that is not
required for sensor functionality. This originated from
all internal and external stakeholders and from broader
implications.
21) System shall follow all IEEE Code of Ethics and common standards. This originated from the IEEE Code of
Ethics.
