# Lessons Learned

- Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 
- What unanticipated problems occurred? 
- What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 
- What “best practices” have you identified? 
- What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
- What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

- My expectations for this project were pretty high because I always set high standard for myself. At the beginning of capstone two, I was so stressed and assuming that we would not be able to get it working. After a month or two of trial and error in coding, we finally got it working and it was the greatest feeling. The group did really well with communication and we had meetings multiple times a week to complete our project.

- I thought we would be able to use Arduino IDE for the entire project, but I was completly wrong. We had to learn how to code with ESP-IDF in VSCode, and that took some time. I figured it would be easy to use the sensor libraries, but once again, I was wrong. We had to code the sensors from scratch with no libraries and that was tough, but we got it done.

- Even though we were on campus everyday 4-5 hours outside of class, I would have like to have the project done sooner so we could have got a better grade. Taking capstone two while full time in school is the most time consuming thing I have ever done, so if I could go back and change something, it would be spending even more time working on this project.

- I would say my public speaking skills have increased in this class due to the amount of speaking we have to do infront of people. I would also say I have a better understanding of understanding what a customer wants and be able to get the information from them about what they want if they do not provide enough.

- Be ready to devote your entire semester to capstone because if you do not, it will be hard to make a good grade and complete everything on time. Take everything a step at a time because it is very very easy to get overwhelmed very quickly.

- I learned more in capstone then I learned in any class I took in college. The amount of research and trial and error in this class tought me how to properly do research, how to code alot more effectively, and how to work better and effectively with a team.

- honestly didn't know what to expect going into capstone. However, after months of persistent coding and teamwork, we achieved success, which was incredibly satisfying. Our group's communication was excellent, with frequent meetings helping us stay on track and complete our project efficiently.

- Initially, I anticipated using Arduino IDE throughout the project, but I was mistaken. We had to learn ESP-IDF coding in VSCode, which was a significant learning curve. Additionally, coding the sensors without libraries was challenging but ultimately rewarding.

- Although we dedicated 4-5 hours every day to the project outside of class, I wish we could have completed it sooner for a better grade. Balancing capstone two with full-time studies was incredibly time-consuming. If I could change something, I would invest even more time in the project.

- This class significantly improved my public speaking skills due to frequent presentations. I also gained a better understanding of eliciting customer needs, especially when information was lacking.

- I would advise future students to allocate their entire semester to capstone as it requires a considerable time commitment for success. Taking it step by step is crucial to avoid feeling overwhelmed.

- Capstone was a true finale to college. The extensive research, documentation, and implenmentation

-From start to finish the project was a series of obstacles. At times it was overwhelming and frustrating. Once, the group or even yourself got over a obstacle you felt a sign relief but you had to be looking ahead and staying on task in order to meet your deadlines. Overall, this course does teach you skills that will translate into your future job like documentation, communication, teamwork, and accountability. 

- Definitely the coding of our sensors was the biggest anticipation of the group. In your head you feel like you have it all planned out and this is going to work like this and sadly that was not the case for our communication module. Instead of using arduino IDE, we had to implement ESP-IDF which I think any of us had previous experience with unlike arduino IDE. So, we had to learn on the fly and watch alot of youtube and research alot more than intended.

- Even though we already spent countless hours on our capstone project, it just felt like we still needed more time to really accomplish what we set out to do. But time is a constraint and you have to manage with what you are given.

- Researching is very helpful and being able to look at datasheets to see if the product is going to meet your desired needs is a big thing. Also, communication with your team is another big practice because of the aspect of everyone is on the same page or even you need some help with your system you always got another mind there for your benefit.

- Time management is going to be your biggest friend and enemy. The project will eat up alot of your time during the semester with signoffs being checked off or even experimentation testing. Luckily, I only had 6 hours this semester so I could almost fully commit to our project, but if that was a different scenario I could see myself under alot of stress.

- Literally taking everything I learned in undergrad and being able to tie everything in together with one big project. Also, I felt like this class helped with my public speaking skills as well.
