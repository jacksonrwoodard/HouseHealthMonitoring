# Lessons Learned

- Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 
- What unanticipated problems occurred? 
- What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 
- What “best practices” have you identified? 
- What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
- What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone.

- My expectations for this project were pretty high because I always set high standard for myself. At the beginning of capstone two, I was so stressed and assuming that we would not be able to get it working. After a month or two of trial and error in coding, we finally got it working and it was the greatest feeling. The group did really well with communication and we had meetings multiple times a week to complete our project.

- I thought we would be able to use Arduino IDE for the entire project, but I was completly wrong. We had to learn how to code with ESP-IDF in VSCode, and that took some time. I figured it would be easy to use the sensor libraries, but once again, I was wrong. We had to code the sensors from scratch with no libraries and that was tough, but we got it done.

- Even though we were on campus everyday 4-5 hours outside of class, I would have like to have the project done sooner so we could have got a better grade. Taking capstone two while full time in school is the most time consuming thing I have ever done, so if I could go back and change something, it would be spending even more time working on this project.

- I would say my public speaking skills have increased in this class due to the amount of speaking we have to do infront of people. I would also say I have a better understanding of understanding what a customer wants and be able to get the information from them about what they want if they do not provide enough.

- Be ready to devote your entire semester to capstone because if you do not, it will be hard to make a good grade and complete everything on time. Take everything a step at a time because it is very very easy to get overwhelmed very quickly.

- I learned more in capstone then I learned in any class I took in college. The amount of research and trial and error in this class tought me how to properly do research, how to code alot more effectively, and how to work better and effectively with a team.
