## Fire Module Experimentation

#### Purpose of Experiment

The purpose of this experiment is to show that the fire sensor used in the Preserve Home Pro is accurate and can consistently provide appropriate data to the user. In the experiment the team is measuring the temperature of a room and outputting that temperature to the head unit for the user to see. The head unit will display a notification if the temperature has reached 176&deg;F, warning the user that a potential fire is present in the room.

#### Experimental Procedure

For testing purpose, the team did a few different experiments. First, we tested the temperature sensor compared to the thermometer in a room. Second, we tested the temperature sensor compared to the temperature displayed on the weather app for the temperature outside. Finally, we tested the temperature of the flame from a lighter (to act as a fire). The temperature sensor used for the Preserve Home Pro does not have the capabilities to read the temperature of the flame from the lighter, but it was used to show that the system can display a warning if a fire is present.

#### Expected Results

The expected results were explained in the purpose of the experiment, but the expected results are for the temperature sensor to accurately output the temperature to the head unit and send a warning to the user if the temperature reaches 176&deg;F.
